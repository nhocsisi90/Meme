# Meme

The Meme App allows users to caption memes based on the most popular stock images that are currently in use. What this means is that a user no longer has to search for an existing meme to suit the situation; they can caption one themselves and share it!


*Note: The API can be fairly slow at times so please be patient during loading. Also, there may be a delay when navigating back directly from the captioning fragment to the list of images - the RecyclerView is redrawing the images.
